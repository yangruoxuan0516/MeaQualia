There are some features of a person's mind that we would expect to be constant, like which advertisement would be more appealing to him or her, the willingness to forgo a short-term reward for a greater reward in the future, or his or her career aspirations. Yet even those characteristics seem to depend on which module is in control, and the choice of module if not typically made by some kind of conscious self, instead, it is always the module most activated by the environment that takes "control"

The modules try to get the "self"'s attention with emotions.

Feelings are the things that give modules power over you.



why the concept of self exist ??
the different combinations of modules make one person differ from another
kinda of coorespond to the mbti theory ?
