I'm reading Anne of the green gables for my English reading projet. To be honest, sometimes, especially when I don't feel very well about myself, I don't enjoy reading the parts when Anne "worries so much and feels that she is to fail but in the end things always turns out to be well"...

Let be do some "nuancer". It's not that I don't appreciate her dreaming everyday and being positive, it's just she seems to me to be too positive to be true. Her imagination and lively "big words" as well as the dreamy description of the scenery in the book do cheer me up when I read them on a beautiful day with birds and flowers, but not during the long, cold, dark winter at Paris...

I guess I'm just confused about her managing to be positive in the face of whatever difficulty, and envy that kind of spirit with sorrow.
